              The traditional image of a boss yelling instructions at their team is widely recognized as ineffective and
              unhelpful in terms of leadership. However, I hold the belief that the alternative image of a leader
              constantly working alongside their team is equally flawed. I have observed numerous leaders attempting to
              showcase their own expertise by taking on the role of the team lead in addition to their managerial
              responsibilities. Unfortunately, this mindset often leads to a host of issues, including inefficiency and
              high turnover rates.
            </p>
            <p class="specializing-in-ux">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="specializing-in-ux">
              Instead, I prefer to relate myself as a leader who constructs and supports a bridge for my team. I inspire
              and provide a clear vision, establish connections, and remove obstacles. Most importantly, I enable my
              team members to perform my best work. However, it is essential to recognize that the responsibility for
              carrying out the work rests with the team, not solely with the manager. I understand the significance of
              granting autonomy while simultaneously enforcing accountability with my team.
            </p>
            <p class="specializing-in-ux">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="specializing-in-ux">
              In my experience, I have discovered that creating and sustaining winning teams is best achieved through
              transparency, accountability, teamwork, and a sense of ownership. To assemble such teams, I meticulously
              hire exceptional individuals who possess the necessary skills and background to solve problems. I equip
              them with the tools, guidance, and training required for success and then give them the autonomy to
              flourish.

            <p class="specializing-in-ux">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="specializing-in-ux">
              Once the team is in place, my role becomes that of a navigator, providing clear direction by defining
              objectives and key results. I allow the team the flexibility to determine the best approach to achieve
              those objectives/results. Clear expectations are set, and both the team and I are held accountable for
              meeting them.

            <p class="specializing-in-ux">
              To establish a culture of scalable innovation, I firmly believe in delegating decision-making and
              accountability to the furthest extent possible within the team. This approach fosters a collective of
              leaders rather than followers, empowering every team member to contribute and take ownership of their
              responsibilities.

              When I started as Digital design lead, Megalatha was already
              pioneering UX-design in our studio in Bangalore. She made the initial
              connections with dev teams and POs which we much needed to take
              Signify's UX for prof services to the next level. She demonstrated the
              ability to serve and manage many businesses and stakeholders, often
              remote, never losing track of the end user and our internal UX-goals.
              She is ever learning, constructive as well as receptive as a global
              team player and certified as a SAFe PO/PM - which is really helpful
              when trying to improve value-focus and efficiency of your operations.
