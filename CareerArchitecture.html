              relatively short tenure of approximately 9 months at Target has been
              highly engaging and rewarding. It provided me with a unique
              opportunity to collaborate with individuals across diverse roles,
              contributing to the development of my business acumen in an
              accelerated manner.

              The career trajectories in UX often diverge from traditional linear
              paths, as there is no singular prescribed route to a successful career
              in this field.
            </p>
            <p class="professional-development-is">
              Many existing career frameworks are designed around the notion of a
              linear path, which can limit individuals' ability to envision their
              own authentic career journeys.

            <p class="professional-development-is">
              To address this, we propose adopting the concept of a trellis as a
              metaphor for growth, care, and nurturing—the very qualities that
              resonate with human aspirations.
            </p>
            <p class="professional-development-is">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="professional-development-is">
              In the context of UX, the trellis represents the expansion and
              development of expertise across various practices, the acquisition of
              new skills, and the continuous growth in existing skills. It
              emphasizes the importance of holistic professional development and the
              ability to flourish in multiple dimensions within the field of UX.
